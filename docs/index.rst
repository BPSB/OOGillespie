The OOGillespie Module
======================

This module provides a class that allows to simulate a stochastic process with discrete, Poissonian events with the Gillespie algorithm.

In contrast to other implementations it embraces object-oriented programming, which has its advantages and disadvantages:

* It is easy to use if you are already familiar with object-oriented programming in Python.

* It may be good for you if its way of doing things comes to you naturally.

* It is very flexible.

* It is not fast.
